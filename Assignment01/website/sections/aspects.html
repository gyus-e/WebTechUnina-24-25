                    Below the surface of the machine, the program moves. Without effort,
                    it expands and contracts. In great harmony, electrons scatter and
                    regroup. The forms on the monitor are but ripples on the water. The
                    essence stays invisibly below.
                    <br/>
                    When the creators built the machine, they put in the processor and the
                    memory. From these arise the two aspects of the program.
                    <br/>
                    The aspect of the processor is the active substance. It is called
                    Control. The aspect of the memory is the passive substance. It is
                    called Data.
                    <br/>
                    Data is made of merely bits, yet it takes complex forms. Control
                    consists only of simple instructions, yet it performs difficult
                    tasks. From the small and trivial, the large and complex arise.
                    <br/>
                    The program source is Data. Control arises from it. The Control
                    proceeds to create new Data. The one is born from the other, the
                    other is useless without the one. This is the harmonious cycle of
                    Data and Control.
                    <br/>
                    Of themselves, Data and Control are without structure. The programmers
                    of old moulded their programs out of this raw substance. Over time,
                    the amorphous Data has crystallised into data types, and the chaotic
                    Control was restricted into control structures and functions.
