                    A student was complaining about digital numbers. 'When I take the root
                    of two and then square it again, the result is already inaccurate!'.
                    Overhearing him, Fu-Tzu laughed, and said 'Here is a sheet of paper. Write down
                    the precise value of the square root of two for me'. Fu-Tzu's student did as

                    Fu-Tzu said 'When you cut against the grain of the wood, much strength
                    is needed. When you program against the grain of a problem, much code
                    is needed.'

                    Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were boasting about the size of their latest
                    programs. 'Two-hundred thousand lines', said Tzu-li, 'not counting
                    comments!'. 'Psah', said Tzu-ssu, 'mine is almost a MILLION lines
                    already.' Fu-Tzu said 'My best program has five hundred lines.'
                    Hearing this, Tzu-li and Tzu-ssu were enlightened.

                    A student had been sitting motionless behind his computer for hours,
                    frowning darkly. He was trying to write a beautiful solution to a
                    difficult problem, but could not find the right approach. Fu-Tzu hit
                    him on the back of his head and shouted 'Type something!'. The student
                    started writing an ugly solution. After he had finished, he suddenly
                    understood the beautiful solution.
