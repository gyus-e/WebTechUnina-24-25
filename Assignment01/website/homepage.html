                This website contains fragments from the <em>Book of Programming</em>, 
                an ancient tome lost to time.
                <br>
                The book is said to have been written by a disciple of <a href="people/fu-tzu.html">Fu-Tzu</a>,
                the legendary master programmer.

                Currently, two sections have been recovered:
                <ul>
                    <li>A section describing the two <a href="sections/aspects.html">aspects of programming</a> (data and control);</li>
                    <li>A section reporting <a href="sections/wisdom.html">short-sayings and other wisdom</a> of the master Fu-Tzu.</li>
                </ul>
