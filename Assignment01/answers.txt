1: GET request to: 
http://localhost/website/signup.html

The query string is:
?fname=giuseppe&
lname=amato&
bday=1997-12-17&
gender=male&
password=ciao&
confirmpassword=ciao&
bio=hello+everynyan&
color=%23000000


2: POST request to:
http://localhost/website/signup.html

There is no query string: the message is passed as the body of the HTTP request.

If no action for POST requests has been configured, nothing else will happen.
Otherwise:
- In Apache2 Web Server, the action will be executed.
- In Nginx, ERROR 405 NOT ALLOWED.

3: The POST request body is identical to the query string of the GET request (except for the "?" at the beginning):
fname=Giuseppe&
lname=Amato&
bday=1997-12-17&
gender=male&
password=ciao&
confirmpassword=ciao&
bio=hello+everynyan&
color=%23000000


4: The POST request is sent with an empty string in the body for the unspecified field.
If the input is required, the POST request is not sent and the website asks the user to fill out the field.
